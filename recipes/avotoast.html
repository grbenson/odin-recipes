    <h2>Quick and simple!</h2>
    <p><em>Within five minutes, you will be in heaven with this breakfast favorite.</em></p><hr>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large slices crusty, chewy sourdough bread, preferably whole wheat</li>
        <li>1 ripe avocado, halved, pit removed</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Flaky salt and coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Half a lemon or lime</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional Garnishes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Poached or fried eggs</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced pickled or fresh red chiles, such as Fresno or cherry</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced pickled red onions</li>
        <li>Pepitas (pumpkin seeds) or sesame seeds, or both</li>
        <li>Herbs, such as basil, cilantro, mint or baby arugula</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the bread to your liking. Meanwhile, use a wide spoon to remove the avocado halves from the peel, keeping them in large pieces.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the hot toast lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Let cool slightly, then place one avocado half on each slice of toast. Use the back of a fork to roughly mash the avocado into the bread, keeping it as chunky as possible.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a little more salt, and pepper if desired. Squeeze the citrus over the top and add any garnishes. Cut each piece of toast in half if they're large and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
